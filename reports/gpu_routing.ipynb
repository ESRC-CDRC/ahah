        "GPUs present the opportunity to execute highly parallel processes an order of magnitude faster than traditional CPU bound solutions. While GPUs are already widely used in deep learning applications, more focus is being given to their use in traditional data processing when large amounts of data are involved. This article demonstrates how GPUs may be used to parallelise road network routing using the [`cugraph`](https://rapids.ai/) library, speeding up analysis times exponentially over the commonly used [`networkx`](https://networkx.org/) python library.\n",
        "\n",
        "To test our routing, we will be considering the drive-time distance for a collection of postcodes to their nearest GP practice^[Please note that only GP practices that fall within our postcode subset are considered, meaning for outer postcodes our estimates may be inaccurate]. First some functions and classes are loaded in from our base library named `ahah`, `cudf` provides GPU accelerated data frames, and `pandas` provides normal CPU bound data frames."

Due to the mixture of rural and urban settings within the chosen area, there is a relatively large disparity in accessibility between postcodes, while urban centred, dense postcodes have times primarily below 10 minutes, there are a select few remote postcodes with times exceeding 40 minutes. Notably, their relative proximity to GP practices does not account for this large difference, meaning in these remote areas, the road network is responsible for lower accessibility."
